# SML-ITRL-Low-cost-Sensor-Fusion
This project describes the sensor fusion of Wheel Encoders, IMU and Control Inputs taken from Small Vehicles for Autonomy (SVEA). The main objective of sensor fusion was to achieve better odometry and integrate it with GPS coordinates and low cost camera for outdoor localization and navigation.
